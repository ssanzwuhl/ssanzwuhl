>"What I cannot build I do not understand" - RF

# About me! 

I am Santiago Sanz Wuhl (aka Santi), a MSc. student of the Internationaly Physics Study Program of the Universität Leipzig (Germany). 
I have succesfully finished my BSc. studies in the Universidad de Córdoba (Spain) in 2023.

I have a great interest in studying and understanding the fundamental laws that govern our universe, from the smallest to the biggest scales. 
My approach to the topic involves the best tools in the theoretician's toolbox: Physics, Math and Code. Though I enjoy beautiful theorems and lemmas, but one must not 
let mathematics get in the way of the researcher's physical intuition. To build this intuition about obscure physical and mathematical rules, I use coding to 
generate, simulate and visualize data.

# As a coder

My love for puzzles is what pushed me to start coding. In 2016 I obtained most of my algorithmic skills by doing many [projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net) problems. 
When later in life I started my BSc, there were many things I could not keep in my head, so I then began some projects, which include (but are not limited to)
1. A real gas F(r) interaction simulator,
2. An analytical diffraction simulator,
3. An Ising model visualizer,
4. Other projects  based on symbolic calculus to make lab life easier.

My most interesting projects are of course those dedicated to my theses. These involve OOP, data analysis, file organization, file selecting and reading routines, 
data visualization, ....
